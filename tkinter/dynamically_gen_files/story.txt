The old mansion on the outskirts of town had always been rumored to be haunted. No one had lived there for years, and the locals avoided it like the plague. But when a group of teenagers dared each other to spend the night inside the mansion, they didn't realize what kind of horror they were about to unleash.

As the sun set and the shadows grew longer, the teenagers nervously entered the mansion. It was eerily quiet, and the air was thick with a musty, old smell. They explored the first floor, finding nothing but dusty old furniture and cobwebs. But when they climbed the stairs to the second floor, they heard a strange noise coming from one of the rooms.

Slowly, they approached the door and listened. It sounded like someone was crying. One of the teenagers bravely pushed open the door, and they saw her - a ghostly figure sitting on the bed, tears streaming down her face.

The teenagers were frozen in fear as the ghostly woman turned to face them. Her eyes were filled with a deep sadness, and she beckoned them closer. They were drawn towards her, unable to resist her haunting call.

Suddenly, the room grew colder, and a chill ran down their spines. They realized too late that they had fallen into the trap of the mansion's curse. The ghostly woman was not a victim, but a malevolent spirit seeking revenge on those who dared to enter her domain.

As the teenagers screamed in terror, the ghostly woman unleashed her fury upon them. Her ghostly hands reached out, and they felt the icy grip of death upon them. They had unwittingly unleashed the horror of the mansion, and now they would pay the price.

The next morning, the locals found the mansion eerily silent once again. No trace remained of the teenagers who had dared to enter. The mansion had claimed its latest victims, and the legend of its haunting only grew stronger. The curse of the mansion would continue to claim those who dared to test its limits, and the horrors within its walls would remain a mystery forevermore.
