Shrishti: Hey Shreyas, how's it going? Are you studying here in the lounge too?

Shreyas: Yes, I'm working on some chemistry homework. What about you?

Shrishti: I'm stuck on this one word problem about a train. Can you help me out?

Shreyas: Sure, let me take a look. (pause) Okay, so the train travels 60 miles in 2 hours, right?

Shrishti: Yes, that's what it says.

Shreyas: And it's asking how far it will travel in 5 hours at the same speed?

Shrishti: Right.

Shreyas: Well, if it travels 60 miles in 2 hours, we can find its speed by dividing distance by time, which gives us 30 miles per hour.

Shrishti: Okay, got it.

Shreyas: Now we just need to use that speed to find the distance it will travel in 5 hours. So, 30 miles per hour times 5 hours equals 150 miles.

Shrishti: Oh, I see. So the answer is 150 miles.

Shreyas: Yes, exactly. You got it.

Shrishti: Thanks so much, Shreyas. You're a lifesaver.

Shreyas: No problem, happy to help anytime. By the way, have you been keeping up with the lectures in our history class?

Shrishti: Not really, I've been struggling to stay focused. Why do you ask?

Shreyas: Well, I was thinking we could start a study group for the upcoming exam. It might be helpful to have a group of people to discuss the material with.

Shrishti: That's a great idea! Count me in.

Shreyas: Awesome. Let's plan to meet here in the study lounge tomorrow after class. We can invite a few more people too, and make it a regular thing.

Shrishti: Sounds good. Thanks for suggesting it, Shreyas.

Shreyas: Of course, we're all in this together. Let's ace this exam!
