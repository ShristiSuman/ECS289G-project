## System Architecture and Modules
![System Architecture](./images/ECS289G_arch.jpg)

<ul>
<li> <strong>Adaptable Author Input Module</strong></li>
<p> A text multi-input system allows author to enter multiple attributes like genre, start of story, characters and their traits, etc to accomodate unique and creative thinking methods of different authors.</p>
<li><strong> Story generator Module</strong></li>
<p> The inputs fed by the user is provided as an input to GPT module which generates the initial story.</p>
<li> <strong>Dynamic Story Regeneration Editor</strong></li>
<p> An option to edit the initial input leads to dynamic story regenration while still maintaing the crux of storyline.</p>
<li><strong> Character Profile Creator</strong></li>
<p> Profile creation based on the generated story will display character's name, age, traits and backstory. </p>
<li><strong> Character Visualizer</strong></li>
<p> Character Traits along with generated story is used as an input to GAN which results in chracter visualized as an image</p>
<li> <strong>In-Game Dialogue Generator and Editor</strong></li>
<p> Multiple optional attributes like number of characters, genre, location and expected social outcome are accomodated to  develop an in-game dialogue scene which may be edited and regenrated based on author's liking.
</ul>

## Novelity
