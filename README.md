## Usage

 DALLE-E is a very powerful tool which uses natural language descriptions of the scene to generate relevant images. A combination of character traits and generated story is supplied in case of this project to generate avatars of characters which are then embedded along with the profile of the character.
 
 Our project provides a complete integrated framework that can assist any author regardless of their thinking process in most idea generation or brainstorming processes involved for creating a gameâ€™s storyline, characters, appearances, in-game dialogues etc. This helps accommodate authors of different thinking characteristics on a single automated platform to help in story generation, character profile creation.
