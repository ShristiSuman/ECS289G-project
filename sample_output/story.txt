A man walked into the lab with a heavy heart. John had always been a pessimistic person, always seeing the worst in every situation. Today was no different, as he had just received some bad news about his job.

As he entered the lab, he noticed that his colleague, Alex, was already there. Unlike John, Alex was a happy-go-lucky person, always seeing the bright side of things. The contrast between their personalities was stark.

John greeted Alex, but his mind was still preoccupied with his problems. As they worked on their experiment, John's negative thoughts continued to consume him. He was so lost in his own thoughts that he didn't notice when Alex accidentally spilled some chemicals on the floor.

Suddenly, there was a loud explosion. John was thrown back by the force of it and everything went black.

When he woke up, John was disoriented and confused. He looked around and saw that the lab had been destroyed. He saw Alex lying on the ground and rushed over to him. Thankfully, Alex was still breathing.

As John helped Alex up, he noticed something strange. Despite the chaos around them, Alex was still smiling. His happy-go-lucky nature had not been dampened by the explosion.

John couldn't help but admire Alex's resilience. He realized that he had been too consumed by his own negativity, and he needed to learn from Alex's positive outlook on life.

With that realization, John began to change. He started looking at things from a more positive perspective and slowly but surely, his pessimism began to fade away.

In the end, John and Alex both walked out of the destroyed lab. But John was a changed man, now more positive and optimistic than ever before. And he knew that he had Alex to thank for showing him the way.
