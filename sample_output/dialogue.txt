Chris: (Weakly) Hi Eva, it's so good to see you.

Eva: (Softly) Hi Chris, I'm sorry to hear about your illness. How are you feeling?

Chris: (Sighing) I've been better, but I'm hanging in there. It's been tough, but I'm trying to stay positive.

Eva: (Smiling) That's the Chris I know. Always looking on the bright side of things.

Chris: (Chuckling weakly) Yeah, I guess old habits die hard.

Eva: (Sitting on the chair next to Chris's bed) So, how have you been keeping yourself busy? Reading any good books or watching any good movies?

Chris: (Shrugging) Not really. I've been spending most of my time resting, trying to get better.

Eva: (Gently) Well, maybe I can bring you some books or movies to keep you entertained.

Chris: (Grinning weakly) That would be nice. But to be honest, I just like having you here with me. It's been too long since we caught up properly.

Eva: (Squeezing Chris's hand) I feel the same way, Chris. It's so good to see you again.

Chris: (Looking into Eva's eyes) You know, Eva, I've been thinking a lot lately. About life and what's really important.

Eva: (Curiously) What do you mean, Chris?

Chris: (Softly) I mean, that I've realized how much I've missed you. How much I've always cared for you.

Eva: (Surprised) Chris, what are you saying?

Chris: (Taking a deep breath) I'm saying that I love you, Eva. I always have. And I don't want to waste any more time pretending that I don't.

Eva: (Tears welling up in her eyes) Oh Chris, I've always loved you too. But I didn't want to risk losing our friendship.

Chris: (Squeezing Eva's hand) I understand that, Eva. But life is too short to hide our feelings. And who knows what might happen tomorrow. I don't want to have any regrets.

Eva: (Leaning in to kiss Chris gently) I don't want to have any regrets either, Chris. I love you.

Chris: (Smiling weakly) I love you too, Eva. And I'm so glad you're here with me now.
